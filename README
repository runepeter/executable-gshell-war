== Executable WAR Plugin ==

Maven plugin that creates an executable WAR (Internal Jetty server).

      <plugin>
        <groupId>org.brylex.maven</groupId>
        <artifactId>executable-war-plugin</artifactId>
        <executions>
          <execution>
            <phase>package</phase>
            <goals>
              <goal>generate</goal>
            </goals>
          </execution>
        </executions>
      </plugin>

The application can be run in the following way:

  > mvn clean install (builds the app)
  > java -jar target/myapp-1.0-SNAPSHOT-standalone.war (runs the app)

The WAR file includes a simple bootstrap class ExecutableWarMain.class, which uses a custom classloader
that resolves the Jetty runtime from the protected folder WEB-INF/server/ inside the WAR file.

Enjoy!
