== Executable WAR Plugin ==

Check out plugin site: http://s3.brylex.org/executable-war-plugin/index.html (IN PROGRESS)

!! In order to use this plugin you need to clone and build my GShell fork that has built-in JMX support.
!! This can be found at http://github.com/runepeter/gshell.

Maven plugin that creates an executable WAR.

 * Goal war creates an executable WAR with embedded Jetty.
 * Goal gshell-war creates an executable WAR with embedded Jetty and JMX-enabled GShell.

      <plugin>
        <groupId>org.brylex.maven</groupId>
        <artifactId>executable-war-plugin</artifactId>
        <executions>
          <execution>
            <phase>package</phase>
            <goals>
              <goal>war</goal>
              <!-- <goal>gshell-war</goal> -->
            </goals>
          </execution>
        </executions>
      </plugin>

The application can be run in the following way:

  > mvn clean install (builds the app)
  > java -jar target/myapp-1.0-SNAPSHOT-standalone.war (runs the app)

The project WAR-file is slightly amended:

  myapp-1.0-SNAPSHOT-standalone.war/
    ...
    org/
      brylex/
        maven/
          plugin/
            AbstractMain$JarClassLoader.class   - custom classloader used to bootstrap Jetty server.
            AbstractMain.class                  - base bootstrap class.
            ExecutableGShellWarMain.class       - bootstrap class that loads Jetty and GShell.
    bootstrap.properties                        - bootstrap resource used by GShell.
    log4j.properties                            - log4J configuration
    ...
    WEB-INF/
      ...
      server/                                   - contains all runtime dependencies for Jetty and GShell.
      ...

Enjoy!
